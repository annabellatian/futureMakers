<p>I hope to learn more about the applications of AI and how to implement it within projects. I don't understand a lot about AI algorithms and I want to be able to implement them into my own applications. Additionally, I hope to learn more abou the theory behind ideas like neural networks and deep learning as well as its future potential.</p>
I learned about the interconnetions and professions within STEM as well as with computing. My focus group discussed the differences and similarities between these fields, which I found intriguing. Although all these subjects employ logic, one of my peers highlighted the differences in the ways they incorporate creativity. I think they all solve problems but take different processes and steps to reach a conclusion.

### Day 2: 7-7-2021 
Public Narrative
- Story of self: call to leadership
- Story of now: strategy and action
- Story of us: shared values and shared experience  

Story of self: Challenge, Choice, Outcome, Moral  
Challenge: being behind my peers in flute  
Choice: choosing to work harder  
Outcome: feeling proud of my work  
Moral: practice makes perfect, hard work pays off

I learned about the importance of creating a public narrative in order to engage your audience. This skill can be employed to connect with the audience and create a positive change in your community -- as with the case of xxx whose combined story of self, now, and us led him to be able to build a middle and high school in his home village through donations. To be frank, I'm confused as to how it relates to leadership but still enjoyed the experience and learned about how to create my own story! Nevertheless, I really enjoyed Dr. David Kong's seminar and hope I can carry these skills onward.

Hierarchy
- Artificial Intelligence
    - Machine Learning  
        - Neural Network
            - Deep Learning

| Supervised ML | Unsupervised ML |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Trained on labelled data to extrapolate | Trained on unlabelled data to find patterns and relationships |
| Used for classification and regression | Used for clustering |
| Can be difficult and time-consuming to label datasets | Can have inaccuracies and find irrelevant relationships |  

Scikit-Learn cannot visualize data without other data analysis librararies because Scikit-Learn is built to model data through supervised and unsupervised machine learning data. The module is built upon SciPy and therefore requires additional libraries to visualized data.

I learned a lot about how deep learning works and what exactly Tensorflow and Tensor Processing Unit is.  
One real world problem I've thought about is fraud and how people can sign fake signatures. By using ML to analyze a person's signature (or handwriting perhaps) the algorithm would be able to analyze the match between two samples.

Numpy: used for array manipulation  
Scikit-learn: used to create ML models  

Tensors: multi-dimensional arrays with uniform type
- shape: length of each axes
- rank: number of tensor axes
- axes or dimension: dimension of tensor
- size: number of items in a tensor  

Tensorflow vs. Pytorch  
Tensors are multi-dimensional arrays and are used in machine learning to encode multi-dimensional data. For example, a 3D space would require three dimensions: height, width, and depth. While most data can be represented through an array or matrix, tensors can often be the more intuitive and simple data structure depending on the data.  

In the tutorial, I noticed that using Tensorflow, matplotlib, and other ML libraries allows the program to perform a lot of different functions. For instance, it is much simpler to create a graph/plot of data and output the result. Additionally, user Tensorflow allowed for a simple neural network to be created in just a few lines. While it is important to understand the underlying concepts, ML libraries make it easy to program a neural network.
