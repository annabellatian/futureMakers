I learned about the interconnetions and professions within STEM as well as with computing. My focus group discussed the differences and similarities between these fields, which I found intriguing. Although all these subjects employ logic, one of my peers highlighted the differences in the ways they incorporate creativity. I think they all solve problems but take different processes and steps to reach a conclusion.

Story of self: Challenge, Choice, Outcome, Moral  

Public Narrative
- Story of self: call to leadership
- Story of now: strategy and action
- Story of us: shared values and shared experience

Challenge: being behind my peers in flute
Choice: choosing to work harder
Outcome: feeling proud of my work

I learned about the importance of creating a public narrative in order to engage your audience. This skill can be employed to connect with the audience and create a positive change in your community -- as with the case of xxx whose combined story of self, now, and us led him to be able to build a middle and high school in his home village through donations. To be frank, I'm confused as to how it relates to leadership but still enjoyed the experience and learned about how to create my own story! Nevertheless, I really enjoyed Dr. David Kong's seminar and hope I can carry these skills onward.
