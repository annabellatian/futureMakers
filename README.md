The STEM+C Reflection cornerü§î
Student Worksheet


Section 1: What is STEM?

TESTER QUESTION 1 -- What is your Code Number? 
12694

TESTER QUESTION 2 -- What is something to look forward to at our future reflection corners?
Getting badges!

TESTER QUESTION 3 -- STEM + Computing Poll Question
Poll question: What does STEM stand for? Highlight/Change the Color/Bold one of the following options as your answer.
Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics
Science, Typography, English, and Music
Statistics, Technology, Economics, and Media Studies
Statistics, Trigonometry, Environmental Studies, and Mathematics

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- STEM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics. Reflect very briefly on which one of these areas in STEM you would enjoy seeing yourself as the most. 
I think I would enjoy technology the most because I am the most interested in computer science.


Section 2: Science + Computing

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- What are your views on scientists‚Äô use of computer simulations in replacement of live experiments to simulate the living processes of real subjects, environment, or communities?
Simulations can be a great alternative, but possibly used as a starting point before in vivo or in vitro experiments are performed.


Section 3: Technology + Computing

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- Does Technology and Computing belong in every career or subject? Why or why not? (ex. The growing popularity of a certain tool or computing language; AI-driven solutions more common)
Yes because every career and subject can be improved or advanced through the use of technology and STEM. This can range from automating tasks to recording information. 

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- What are some of the environmental risks, national crises, or global challenges we may face in the near future of human civilization? How can we use Technology, AI, or Computing to help?
Climate change can be prevented from furthering by using simulations to test viable solutions. Additionally, by modelling the effects of global warming in the future scientists and society can better understand the threat of climate change.

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- How have you seen Technology, AI, or Computing change in the last five years? (ex. The growing popularity of a certain tool or computing language; AI-driven solutions more common)
Technology has become much more the norm and accessible in the past five years with a greater part of the population having smart phones.

Technology + Computing Poll
Poll Question: At what stage (K-5/Elementary School; 6-8/Middle School; 9-12/High School; Post-High College/Higher Education) should students start learning about AI, Technology, and Computing? Highlight/Change the Color/Bold one of the following options as your answer.
K-5/Elementary School 
6-8/Middle School 
9-12/High School
Post-High School Trade/Higher Education

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- At what stage (K-5/Elementary School; 6-8/Middle School; 9-12/High School; College/Higher Education) should students start learning about AI, Technology, and Computing?
It‚Äôs important for children to be exposed to technology from a young age, especially the potential negative consequences. Learning about technology may not include programming, but rather other concepts like computational thinking and action.


Section 4: Engineering + Computing

‚ÄúWhat type of engineer should you be‚Äù Poll
Let‚Äôs Reflect -- Did the type of engineer you got match some of the interests or ideas that you have for your future career? Why or why not?
I got software engineer which matches my interests in computer science. I hope to pursue computer science in higher education.

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- How would you use computing for this type of engineering?
Software engineering centers on computing as it involves creating programs on computers in order to achieve a goal.


Section 5: Mathematics + Computing

Activity: Bella‚Äôs Personal Narrative -- Quickly describe someone that you know who is a ‚ÄúMathematician‚Äù or who thinks ‚ÄúMathematically‚Äù when solving different problems.
I think my mom thinks mathematically when cooking. When she cooks, she is always thinking about how to maximize her time and cook all her components efficiently. 

Describe the question that your group reflected on using your own words.
My group reflected on the various ways that those in STEM think and approach problem solving. Specifically, we focused on how these position differentiate in their approaches.

Let‚Äôs Reflect -- Reflect and write on your personal thoughts about the topic your group received and discussed in your focus group session. Were there any arguments/points that you or other students made that you agreed with? (Challenge: Aim for three minutes)
The questions we discussed interested me as I personally am considering various paths in STEM and found it helpful to discuss how scientists, computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians vary in their thinking and approaches to problem solving. I think the points that my peers brought up were very interesting. They commented on the fact that while all the STEM professions involved logic, the extent or way they employ creativity varies. Additionally, I brought up that while they often work towards similar goals (proving a theory, finding a pattern, etc), the steps taken to achieve that goal vary with each of the positions.

Story of self: Challenge, Choice, Outcome, Moral
Public Narrative
Story of self: call to leadership
Story of now: strategy and action
Story of us: shared values and shared experience

Challenge: being behind my peers in flute
Choice: choosing to work harder
Outcome: feeling proud of my work

I learned about the importance of creating a public narrative in order to engage your audience. This skill can be employed to connect with the audience. To be frank, I'm confused as to how it relates to leadership but still enjoyed the experience and learned about how to create my own story!
