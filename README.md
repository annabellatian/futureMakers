<p>I hope to learn more about the applications of AI and how to implement it within projects. I don't understand a lot about AI algorithms and I want to be able to implement them into my own applications. Additionally, I hope to learn more abou the theory behind ideas like neural networks and deep learning as well as its future potential.</p>
I learned about the interconnetions and professions within STEM as well as with computing. My focus group discussed the differences and similarities between these fields, which I found intriguing. Although all these subjects employ logic, one of my peers highlighted the differences in the ways they incorporate creativity. I think they all solve problems but take different processes and steps to reach a conclusion.

### Day 2: 7-9-2021
Story of self: Challenge, Choice, Outcome, Moral  
Public Narrative
    - Story of self: call to leadership
    - Story of now: strategy and action
    - Story of us: shared values and shared experience

Challenge: being behind my peers in flute  
Choice: choosing to work harder  
Outcome: feeling proud of my work  

I learned about the importance of creating a public narrative in order to engage your audience. This skill can be employed to connect with the audience and create a positive change in your community -- as with the case of xxx whose combined story of self, now, and us led him to be able to build a middle and high school in his home village through donations. To be frank, I'm confused as to how it relates to leadership but still enjoyed the experience and learned about how to create my own story! Nevertheless, I really enjoyed Dr. David Kong's seminar and hope I can carry these skills onward.

Hierarchy
- Artificial Intelligence
    - Machine Learning  
        - Neural Network
            - Deep Learning

| Supervised ML | Unsupervised ML |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Trained on labelled data to extrapolate | Trained on unlabelled data to find patterns and relationships |
| Used for classification and regression | Used for clustering |
| Can be difficult and time-consuming to label datasets | Can have inaccuracies and find irrelevant relationships |
